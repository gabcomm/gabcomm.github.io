### Students Explore Aquatic Sciences (SEAS)
<a href="https://fish.uw.edu/students/student-organizations/students-explore-aquatic-sciences-seas"/> SEAS </a> is a volunteer-run organization which engages the Seattle community in all things aquatic science. Through SEAS, I've had a ton of fun running booths at Shoreline Elementary School's STEAM event, and at the UW Aquatic Sciences Open House. Younger students are always so excited to see the creepy-crawly parasites under the microscope.
