### Students Explore Aquatic Sciences (SEAS)
[SEAS](https://fish.uw.edu/students/student-organizations/students-explore-aquatic-sciences-seas) is a volunteer-run organization which engages the Seattle community in all things aquatic science. Through SEAS, I've had a ton of fun running booths at Shoreline Elementary School's STEAM event, and at the UW Aquatic Sciences Open House. Younger students are always so excited to see the creepy-crawly parasites under the microscope. 

Check out one of the biggest hit of our booths: the [What Parasite Are You?](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OBSmK1hU4c1HcKWJwtMrEzHIt82Y6JgtThMoVz2-xrE/edit?usp=sharing) quiz!
